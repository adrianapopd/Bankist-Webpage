# Bankist-Webpage
A modern bank website <br>
This is one of my dearest project so far. A modern, minimalist webpage that has the most common modern features implemented in a webpage, like: <br>
Modal Window, <br>
Smooth Scrolling (using window.scrollTo() with section coordonates or the modern way, section.scrolIntoView()), <br>
Tabbed Component, <br>
Menu Fade Animation, <br>
Sticky navigation: Intersection Observer API and Intersection Observer API for Revealing Sections, <br>
Lazy Loading Images for code functionality improvement, <br>
Slider Component, <br>
and implementing other features using Event Delegation. <br>
I developed this project following my Udemy "The Complete JavaScript Course: from zero to Expert" by Jonas S. <br>

Here are some SCREENSHOTS to see my project:
